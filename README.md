# Non preemptive FCFS with highest burst time and normal
Design a scheduler following non-preemptive scheduling approach to schedule the processes that arrives at different units and having burst time double the arrival time. Scheduler selects the process with largest burst time from the queue for the execution. Process is not being preempted until it finishes its service time. Compute the average waiting time and average turnaround time. What should be the average waiting time if processes are executed according to Shortest Job First scheduling approach with the same attribute values
